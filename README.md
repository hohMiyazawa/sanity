# sanity
under construction

A free software client for Anilist

# How do I use it?

1. Run it directly from your computer. Download the files, and open index.html in your browser.

2. Use the example web deployment: <https://hohmiyazawa.github.io/sanity/>

3. Use a third party deployment (none available)

There are few differences between these, since they are all connected to your Anilist account anyway.
